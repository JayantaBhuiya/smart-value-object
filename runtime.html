<h2><a name="basicusage">Basic usage</a></h2>

<p>Once your classes are properly modified, you can test their new features.
The objects will become versionable, that is you can make inquiries
whether the object has been modified, created or deleted. The modification
happens transparently, there should be no visible changement of the object's
behaviour (after all, VOs shouldn't have any behaviour).

<p>While it would be possible to do this by casting the object to its new 
interface "Versionable" to expose its API, the preferred method is to use the 
static methods of the helper class SmartAccess which does all this for you. An
example for its usage:

<pre>
	TestVO test = new TestVO();
	// reset version information
	SmartAccess.reset(test);
	// modify object
	test.setName("test");
	// check for modification
	if (SmartAccess.isDirty(test)) {
		System.out.println("object has been modified");
	}
</pre>

A call to the object's setter "setName" should change the object's state to
"modified", as the setter will most certainly overwrite the field containing
the name.

<p>Other useful methods include:

<ul>
<li>boolean SmartAccess.isVersionable(Object o): verifies if this object is
versionable</li>
<li>boolean SmartAccess.sameVersion(Object o1, Object o2): checks if the two
objects share the same version number</li>
<li>boolean SmartAccess.isCreated(Object o): verifies if the object has been
created by the user</li>
<li>boolean SmartAccess.isDeleted(Object o): verifies if the object has been
deleted by the user</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="containers">Containers</a></h2>

<p>In many cases your VO will contain a collection of other objects, normally
implemented with a class of the Java collection framework.

<p>Now, it would be interesting if you could track changes in these containers,
e.g. know if there have been any additions or deletions in the container. If
the object in the container has been modified (not deleted!) and is a
versionable object, there is no need for further support by the library as it's
already been taken care of by the bytecode modification. 

<p>But as deleted objects would be garbage collected, you have no way to "know"
that the object is no longer in the container, except if you carry a copy of
the old state around or implement custom containers to do this.

<p>The modified transfer objects do this automatically for you: every time you
have an assignment like

<pre>
	Collection c = new ArrayList();
</pre>

in your code, the assignment will be intercepted on runtime and replaced
with a "smart" container. These are wrapper around common interfaces
(java.util.Collection, Map, Set, List) that take care of the versioning.</p>

<p>The condition for this to work is that you assign only to interfaces, not
to concrete types. Otherwise the interception will fail and you end up
with a normal container.

<p>The main difference with respect to the "normal" containers is that newly
added objects get
a 'created' flag while deleted objects are flagged as, 'deleted'. Once
deleted they still remain in the container but are no longer visible to the
application. That means all methods invoked on the container will behave like
the objects had really been deleted.

<p>Again, to get this 'hidden' information you need to use SmartAccess. It
offers the following methods to work with smart containers:

<pre>
	SmartAccess.isSmartContainer(Object o);  // checks if object is a smart container
	SmartAccess.isContainerModified(Object o);  // checks if objects in the container have been modified
	SmartAccess.deletedIterator(Object o);  // gets an iterator for all deleted objects
	SmartAccess.createdIterator(Object o);  // gets an iterator for all added objects
</pre>

<p>In a client/server scenario the server can use this method to do a quick
check if updates to the storage tier are necessary. The component which does
this checks acts as a mediator between the versioned value objects and the
backing storage.
