<p>If, after reading the <a href="introduction.html">introduction</a>, you're
not quite sure about the purpose of the project, have a look at the diagram
below:

<center><img src="svo_diagram.png" alt="SVO digram"></center>

<p>It shows a basic use case of the project: the client has a graph of objects
(whether it was created locally or obtained from the server is not important
for now) which it wants to change and save on the server. In this simple case
we assume that it's not a real graph but a single object.

<p>First it calls a method on this object: e.g. someObject.setName("foo"). As
'someObject' is an instance of a 'smart' VO, it detects the change of state
and updates its version information to 'modified'.

<p>Then, when the user wants to save the data, it tells a component called
<a href="mediators.html">mediator</a> to perform an update by calling 
updateGraph(someObject) (step 2). This component will then verify that the
object has been changed (step 3), and do the actual update (step 4).

<p>The analysis of modifications can prove useful in a client/server scenario,
where the state of the client must be synchronized with the server. By only
sending modified objects the network traffic can be reduced drastically.
