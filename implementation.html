<h1><a name="implementation">Implementation</a></h1>

<h2><a name="basic">Overview</a></h2>

<p>As already mentioned, the modified classes implement the Versionable
interface. This is done by adding a new field called version, which itselfs
contains an object implementing Versionable. Calls to this interface directed
to the outer object are delegated to this instance (for the moment of type <a
href="javadoc/org/bsf/smartValueObject/Version.html">org.bsf.smartValueObject.Version</a>).

<p>This technique is necessary to create a 'mixin' which has additional
behaviour without using inheritance. The version field is actually initialized
on object creation, in the constructor. It is not yet possible to specify an
arbitrary class to be used as implementing class, but this would add further
flexibility as custom implementations could specify additional behaviour.

<p>Normally there is an 1:1 relation between a transfer object and its
corresponding version object. But it's also possible to have a version object
shared by serveral instances, so that a change in one object affects the state
of the others (interesting for modeling child-parent relationships). For the
moment the library uses a strict version-per-instance relationship.

<p>The version object contains the state information of the transfer object
(object modified / deleted / added). Additionally it contains a version number
to allow version control. The current implementation uses a timestamp for this
purpose.

<p>The state transitions are controlled either by the transfer object itself,
as every write access to a field is intercepted. If the type of the field to be
written to is primitive or in the java.lang.* hierachy, the equals method is
additionally invoked to verify that the field is really to be changed.
Then, the version object's state changes to 'dirty'. But this really
depends on the actual implementation of the Versionable interface, as it just
gets informed that a field has been "touched".

<p>The object state can also be changed with the helper class <a
href="javadoc/org/bsf/smartValueObject/SmartAccess.html">SmartAccess</a>, to
reset the state etc. This would normally happen on the server side, to reset
any flags before sending the object to the client. The client shouldn't really
have to care about the version state of the transfer objects.

<p>To deal with collections, serveral wrapper classes have been created which
intercept calls to the containers. To avoid using further bytecode
manipulation, the classes are normal Java objects which are instantiated by the
modified transfer objects:

<pre>
	Collection c = new ArrayList();
</pre>

is changed into:

<pre>
	Collection c = new SmartCollection(new ArrayList(), Versionable v);
</pre>

<p>The wrapper classes act as proxy to respect the versioning information
contained in the objects:

<pre>
	Collection c = new ArrayList();
	c.remove(anObject);
</pre>

<p>This will flag the object 'anObject' as deleted, if the object itself
implements the Versionable interface. The class <a
href="javadoc/org/bsf/smartValueObject/container/SmartIterator.html">SmartIterator</a>
is used by the collections to provide a view on the objects which is identical
to the normal, unmodified classes.


<h2><a name="difference">Comparing Javassist - ASM</a></h2>

<p>Let's see how the modification is actually done by comparing the two existing
implementations:

<td width="50%">
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i < methods.length; i++) {
CtMethod method = methods[i];
StringBuffer body = new StringBuffer();
if (method.getReturnType() != CtClass.voidType) {
	body.append("return ");
}

// ($$) javassist specific macro (expanded to parameters)
// field.methodname(1st parameter, 2nd parameter...)
body.append(field.getName() + (".") + method.getName() + "($$);");

// make new method using the signature of the interface's method
// and the body defined above, add it to class
CtMethod newMethod = CtNewMethod.make(
		method.getReturnType(),

declaring.addMethod(newMethod);

codevisitor.visitFieldInsn(GETFIELD,

	VERSIONFIELD,
	Type.getDescriptor(Versionable.class));

codevisitor.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEINTERFACE,

<p>The code shown on the left is the javassist way of doing modifications, on
the right you have the ASM equivalent (shortened to be more readable).

<p>Both do the same thing: implementing the Versionable interface by invoking
the methods on the field 'version' of the object. Javassist lets you create a
new method by a static factory CtMethod.newMethod(...), whereas with ASM you
have to visit the class object first to create the method, then visit the
method to create the instructions in a very low-level approach. The visitor
pattern used by ASM allows for a very tight library size, but as a trade-off
your code can get very complicated.

<p>A nice feature of Javassist is its runtime compile mechanism: all you need
to do is to create a string containing the code to be generated, Javassist
then takes care of the rest.

<p>In this example, the parameters of the original method are in a
Javassist-specific variable '$$' which will be expanded on runtime to the
complete list of parameters, just before the compilation step. 

<p>On the other hand, with ASM you need to emit the bytecode yourself - you
even need to deal with the differences between primitive and reference types.
The problem is that the ASM implementation is getting unmaintable so we'll
stick to the Javassist version for the moment. A solution would be to use <a
href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net">cglib</a>, a library which adds a layer of
abstraction to ASM to avoid these problems. This wouldn't buy a lot in terms of
library size, as you can see in the table below.
